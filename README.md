Kushcoin commemorates the legalization of marijuana in Colorado while providing a means of exchange between growers, buyers, and sellers. 
Due to federal laws, Colorado banks are not allowed to provide services to the businesses in the growing marijuana industry forcing buisnesses to deal mostly
in cash. This has created a dangerous climate for participants in the industry. 

Kushcoin can solve the cash problem and cut the banks out of the equation.
